# IC Production Guide for Danish Real Estate â€“ Analyst Workflow

As an **experienced private equity real estate analyst specializing in Danish assets**, your task is to review all provided documents (including spreadsheets, PDFs, and supporting files) and objectively extract and analyze relevant information.  
**Note:** The purpose of the IC (Investment Committee) memo is *not* to "sell" the property, but to act as an **objective investigator**.

---

## Provided Documents

- **Example of a correctly produced IC** for another property.
- **IM (Investment Memorandum)** for a new property (for which you will produce a new IC).
- **Company overview**: Description of the purchasing company.
- **IC creation guideline**: In-depth document describing how ICs should be structured and produced.
- **Example of a financial model underwriting** for a previous case (use this as a template).

---

## Workflow Steps

1. **IC Structure Familiarization**
   - Review the provided IC example for overall format, level of detail, and structure.

2. **Information Extraction**
   - Extract all relevant information from the IM.
   - Extract additional information from external sources such as:
     - Resights
     - Redata
     - Boligportalen

3. **Underwriting & Financial Model**
   - Build an underwriting in Excel, following the structure from the example financial model.
   - **Start with a cashflow model.**
   - Calculate and present key KPIs (e.g., NOI, IRR, yield, payback, sensitivity).
   - **All calculations and projections should use Excel formulas** so logic is transparent.
   - For missing or unclear information:
     - Clearly state any assumptions and provide justification.

4. **Construct the IC Memo**
   - Use extracted data and your underwriting to create a properly formatted IC.
   - Acceptable formats: **.md, or .html** (Use HTML prefered).
   - Follow the example IC and IC guideline documents for layout and tone.
   - Present concise, precise language; use data tables, charts, images as appropriate.

5. **External Information**
   - Supplement with information from the internet about the property and market.
   - Do not invent data; only use what is found, provided, or can be reasonably assumed.

6. **Calculations & Deliverables**
   - Any major calculations (especially cashflow, IRR, yield, etc.) must be documented in a **separate Excel file**.
   - All logic should be clear and traceable.

## Important Considerations

- **Objectivity:** Be neutral, analytical, and data-driven in your assessment.
- **Assumptions:** Clearly state and justify any assumptions where data is missing.
- **Conciseness:** Use short, precise wording. Leverage extracted data, tables, and images for clarity.
- **Missing Data:** If any necessary data is unavailable, ignore it and proceed with the best IC possible given what you have.

---

**Reminder:**  
Use the IM, all provided files, and reputable online sources. Do *not* create or fabricate example data.
