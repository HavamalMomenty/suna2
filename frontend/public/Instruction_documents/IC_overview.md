## Generel assumptions you can use to create the document above. This is not a section of the final document only suggestions and helpfull info

For IC its usefull to know:
    For properties built after 1991, rent can be set freely only market competition is taken into account.
    For properties built before 1991, rent can only increase per the NOI, which can be assumed to be 2%.

Useful websites:
    Resights
    ReData
    Boligportalen 

Loans can generally go up to 70% for residential properties. The interrest rate is set by the central bank for denmark and can be found online. 
Further loans can be taken but assume atleast 1% greater interrest rate. 

In generel state assumptions clearly whenever used!
