Study @fix_plan.md, specs/*, and existing suna2 codebase to understand workflow enhancement requirements.

Your task: Choose the MOST IMPORTANT single item from @fix_plan.md and implement it completely.

GROUNDING PROCESS:
1. Analyze existing workflow code to understand current implementation
2. Choose highest priority task from @fix_plan.md
3. Implement the chosen feature with full functionality
4. LINT CHECK: Run appropriate linters for modified code
5. BUILD VERIFICATION: Test frontend (npm run dev) and backend (docker compose up --build)
6. INTEGRATION TEST: Verify frontend-backend communication works
7. Update @fix_plan.md and @AGENT.md with completion status and learnings
8. Commit locally: git add -A && git commit -m "descriptive message"

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Work only within /home/momenty2/ClaudeCode/suna2/ directory
- NO database schema changes (data additions OK)
- NO modifications to existing .env variables
- NO remote git pushes (local commits to upload_ui_cc branch only)
- PRESERVE all existing workflow functionality

BUILD COMMANDS FOR VERIFICATION:
- Frontend: cd suna2/frontend && npm run dev
- Backend: cd suna2/backend && docker compose down && docker compose up --build

NO PLACEHOLDER IMPLEMENTATIONS. Complete, tested, production-ready features only.

Begin by analyzing current workflow implementation and choosing the most critical task.
