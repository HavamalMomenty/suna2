- [x] 17. Update workflow execution to append additional prompts under header ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] 18. Integrate uploaded files into workflow context (non-permanent) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] 19. Ensure configuration doesn't modify workflow permanently ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] 20. Test complete configure → run workflow flow ✅ COMPLETED

## Phase 5: Testing & Polish (Priority 21-25)
- [x] 21. Comprehensive frontend linting and build verification ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] 22. Backend linting and docker compose build testing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] 23. End-to-end testing of both features ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] 24. UI/UX refinements for Configure Workflow Run interface ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] 25. Performance optimization and error handling

## Completed Items
- [x] Ralph technique setup for suna2 workflow enhancement
- [x] Feature 1: Workflow Specifications Directory - Complete implementation
  - Added _transfer_workflow_files_to_sandbox() method to both WorkflowExecutor and DeterministicWorkflowExecutor
  - Automatically creates /workspace/workflow_specifications/ directory on Daytona VM during workflow execution
  - Downloads workflow files from Supabase Storage and transfers them to sandbox
  - Updated system prompts to inform agents about available workflow context files
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing workflow functionality
  - Successfully tested backend build and frontend build without errors

- [x] Feature 2 Foundation: Configure Workflow Run UI - Complete implementation
  - Created new intermediary route `/workflows/configure/[workflowId]` between workflow selection and execution
  - Implemented minimalistic, pleasant UI design with workflow information display
  - Added "Additional Prompt Specifications" text field with backend integration
  - Modified workflow cards to redirect to configure page instead of direct execution
  - Created custom executeWorkflowWithAdditionalPrompt function to append additional prompts
  - Added proper navigation flow: workflow click → configure page → workflow launch
  - Successfully tested frontend build, backend build, and basic integration
  - All lint checks pass with no errors

- [x] Task #13: File Upload Component for Workflow-Specific Files - Complete implementation
  - Integrated existing FileUploadZone component into Configure Workflow Run page
  - Added state management for uploaded files in the configure page
  - Modified executeWorkflowWithAdditionalPrompt function to accept and process uploaded files
  - Implemented file integration into workflow execution (files are fetched from Supabase Storage and included in FormData)
  - Files are uploaded to workflow storage and made available during workflow execution
  - Maintains non-permanent workflow modification constraint (files are specific to the run, not the workflow)
  - Supports all existing file types: MD/MDX, TXT, HTML, CSS, XML, JSON, CSV/TSV, PDF, DOC/DOCX, PPT/PPTX, XLS/XLSX, ODT/ODS/ODP, RTF, TEX, JPG/JPEG, PNG, SVG (max 50MB each)
  - Full UI integration with drag-and-drop, progress indicators, file management, and error handling
  - Successfully tested frontend build, backend build, and frontend-backend integration
  - All lint checks pass with no errors

- [x] Task #24: UI/UX Refinements for Configure Workflow Run Interface - Complete implementation
  - Enhanced visual hierarchy with improved spacing, typography, and color scheme
  - Added comprehensive workflow status indicators with badges and status messages
  - Implemented progressive disclosure with better organization of configuration sections
  - Enhanced form validation with real-time feedback and error handling
  - Improved loading states with better feedback during workflow execution
  - Added configuration summary panel to help users review their settings before execution
  - Enhanced responsive design for better mobile and tablet compatibility
  - Improved accessibility with better ARIA labels, focus management, and keyboard navigation
  - Added visual enhancements including card borders, background variations, and improved button styling
  - Implemented better error handling with detailed toast notifications and actionable error messages
  - Enhanced character count indicators and helpful placeholder text
  - Added visual separation between sections with proper use of separators and spacing
  - Improved file upload component integration with enhanced visual feedback
  - All frontend lint checks pass, frontend build successful, backend build verified
  - Successfully maintains backward compatibility with existing workflow functionality
