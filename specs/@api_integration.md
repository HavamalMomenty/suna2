# API Integration Specifications

## Backend Changes Required

### New Endpoints
- POST /workflows/{id}/configure - Save temporary configuration
- POST /workflows/{id}/run-configured - Launch with configuration

### Modified Endpoints
- Existing workflow launch endpoints to accept additional parameters
- File upload endpoints to handle workflow-specific files

### Data Flow
1. Configure Workflow Run UI → Backend temporary storage
2. User clicks "Run Workflow" → Launch with stored configuration
3. Additional prompts appended with header: "## Additional Specifications"
4. Files injected into workflow context

## Frontend Integration
- API client updates for new endpoints
- State management for configuration data
- File upload integration with existing patterns
- Error handling and user feedback

## Constraints
- NO permanent workflow modifications
- NO database schema changes (can add configuration data)
- Maintain existing API compatibility
- Follow current authentication/authorization patterns
