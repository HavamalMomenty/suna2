# LlamaParse Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the LlamaParse document parsing system in the Suna backend.

## How i fixed the persistent issue:

1. llama clouds services where not able to imported
2. i used from llama_parse import LlamaParse   which resultet in error where parser did not have the .parse method... very confusing!
3. Key information used to solve the issue:
    1. Only the backend docker file is relevant for the llama parse implementation 
    2. The .venv INSIDE the backend docker is the environment actually being used to run the tools, hence just running "RUN pip install --no-cache-dir llama-parse==0.4.9" does not solve it, we needed 
    "RUN if [ ! -x /app/.venv/bin/pip ]; then \
        python -m venv /app/.venv; \
    fi \
    && /app/.venv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip \
    && /app/.venv/bin/pip install llama-cloud-services==0.6.46" 
    This downloads the dependency to the .venv inside the docker. 
    3. Only needed to add files suna2/backend/agent/tools/llama_parse_tool.py  as well as changes to the prompt.py and run.py to add the tool.
    4. Dependencies where of course added to the docker itself as described in point 2!
    5. All .env variables are to be added to suna2/backend/utils/config.py ie. not the values but the fields, then its easy to load in using dotenv. 

## Overview

The LlamaParse integration enables automatic parsing of complex document types (PDFs, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations) into structured JSON format, making these documents more accessible to LLMs and agent tools. The implementation follows a secure pattern where document parsing occurs in the backend container, while file storage and access happens through the Daytona sandbox environment.
